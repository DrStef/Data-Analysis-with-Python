# Data Analysis with Python

This project was part of IBM Data Science certificate. https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science



##  Dataset and Objective.

Dataset: cars, various makes, specifications and prices. 
After cleaning the dataset, and running statistics, we develop several models that will predict the price of a car using a set of features/variables. A model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.
